## Single endpoint architecture

The HelpGenie API is served from a single endpoint. Every request is a `POST` to the same URL:

```
POST https://api.helpgenie.ai/v1
```

Instead of traditional REST routing with different URL paths per resource, HelpGenie uses a **resource/action pattern** in the request body. The `resource` field selects which entity to operate on, and the `action` field determines what to do.

```json
{
  "resource": "genies",
  "action": "get",
  "id": "abc-123"
}
```

The API also supports standard REST-style HTTP method routing as an alternative. See [Making requests](/getting-started/making-requests) for details on both approaches.

## Request and response format

Every request body follows this structure:

<ParamField body="resource" type="string" required>
  The resource to operate on (e.g. `genies`, `knowledge-base`, `leads`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="action" type="string" required>
  The operation to perform (e.g. `get`, `all`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="id" type="string">
  The identifier of a specific record. Required for `get`, `update`, and `delete` actions.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="data" type="object">
  The payload for `create` and `update` actions. Contents vary by resource.
</ParamField>

Every response uses a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

On failure, the response includes an `error` object instead:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Resource not found",
    "status": 404
  }
}
```

See [Error handling](/getting-started/errors) for the full list of error codes.
